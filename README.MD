This repo contains all the files for the Landing Page project that is part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The focus is to use Flexbox to create a landing page that consists of a 4 sections and a footer. I decided to separate the header into it's own section rather than combine it with the hero section. This project was quite challenging, but I learned a lot through my time creating it!
